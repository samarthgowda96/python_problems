"""88. Merge Sorted Array Description
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.

Note:
- The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively.
- You may assume that nums1 has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example:
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
