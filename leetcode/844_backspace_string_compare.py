"""844. Backspace String Compare Description
Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.

Example 1:
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".

Example 2:
Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "".

Example 3:
Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "c".

Example 4:
Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".

Note:
1 <= S.length <= 200
1 <= T.length <= 200
S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
