"""98. Validate Binary Search Tree Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

Assume a BST is defined as follows:
The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


Example 1:

    2
   / \
  1   3

Input: [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:

    5
   / \
  1   4
     / \
    3   6

Input: [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4."""
