"""205. Isomorphic Strings
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters.
No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length."""

                mappings[s[i]] = t[i]
            elif s[i] not in mappings and t[i] in list(mappings.values()):
                return False

                if mappings[s[i]] != t[i]:
                    return False
                if list(mappings.values()).count(t[i]) < 1:
                    return False
        return True
